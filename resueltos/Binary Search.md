## Notas adicionales
Have you ever played hot or cold? Binary search is a bit like that.
You have a very limited number of guesses. Try larger jumps between numbers!
The program will randomly choose a new number each time you connect. You can always try again, but you should start your binary search over from the beginning - try around 500. Can you think of why?
